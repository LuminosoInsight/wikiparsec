Next steps:

- normalize the names of inflections
- [[Appendix:English proper nouns]] shouldn't count as a see also link
- More etymology templates: {{prefix}}, {{suffix}}, {{compound}}...
- Handle {{rel4}} and similar meta-templates
- Handle different POS sections that reduce to the same letter as different etymologies/senses
- Stop considering '-adj' or '-nom' in section links to be part of the language
